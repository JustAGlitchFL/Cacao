## 6/2: PCB speedrun
Hours: 4

After staying up much later than I should have, I listened to the LTT WAN show recording from Friday and completed the entire schematic and PCB in one night.

## 6/4: Case
Hours: 3

Dropped the STEP of the PCB into Onshape and sketched out a simple case for this board, with an optionally 3d printed or CNC milled polycarbonate plate and a printed lower. This was pretty quick, as I just finished the case for [CTRL](https://githum.com/JustAGlitchFL/CTRL/README.md).
