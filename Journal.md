## 6/2: PCB speedrun
Hours: 4

After staying up much later than I should have, I listened to the LTT WAN show recording from Friday and completed the entire schematic and PCB in one night.

## 6/4: Case
Hours: 5

Dropped the STEP of the PCB into Onshape and sketched out a simple case for this board, with an optionally 3d printed or CNC milled polycarbonate plate and a printed lower. This was pretty quick, as I just finished the case for [CTRL](https://githum.com/JustAGlitchFL/CTRL/README.md).

Actual update after the case was finished on the zoom, rather than the prospective update before:

This case was not easy, as I legitimately don't remember how I did the other so easily at 4am a few days ago. I still can't get effective design formats out of kicad, so I had to just use the center of each switch and draw a 14mm square around it for the key to rest in. I also had to find the plate cutout for choc stabilizers and replicate it. Also on the call, I helped others with their projects, including researching phased array antenna clusters, cellular tracking, and battery management systems.
