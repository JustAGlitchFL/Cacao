A low-profile keyboard with hot-swappable Kailh Choc switches, 4 macro keys, and an encoder. Now with per-key RGB!

## Why?
I've always liked lower-profile keyboards, and currently use a MX board without a case (PCB on table) to get it thinner. I figured I might as well try Choc switches, and Hackclub's Highway event was the perfect opportunity to.
